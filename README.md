Calculator  

Simple calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I have created a simple Calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The basic structure of the calculator such as: Number button, sign button and the display screen are created using HTML,
Using CSS some styling such as:color to each number button, border-radius, hover are created using CSS. 
And all the logical of the calculator such as Addition, Substration, Multiplication, Division, All Clear and Deleting only the last single number are done using JavaScript.

This is how the Calculator looks like as shown below:
